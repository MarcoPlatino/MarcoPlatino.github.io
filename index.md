# Welcome to my site!
My name is Marco Platino, and I am a student looking to build all sorts of interesting software and learn new concepts.

My technical skills include:
- Python
- Arduino
- Onshape (CAD)
- Linux
- Java

This site is meant to serve as an introduction to what I like to do, but also a collection of some of the projects that I am working on
