# Welcome to my site!
My name is Marco Platino, and I am a student looking to build all sorts of interesting software and learn new concepts.

My technical skills include:
- Python
- Arduino
- Onshape (CAD)
- Linux
- Java

This site is meant to serve as an introduction to what I like to do, but also a collection of some of the projects that I am working on

### Links to projects
- [Euler Kit](https://github.com/MarcoPlatino/EulerKit), a python library to help solve Project Euler Problems
- [Raspberry Pi External System Information Display](https://github.com/MarcoPlatino/externalsysteminfoRPI), a little external display using an LCD to monitor your raspberry pi when running it headless, or just as a nice peripheral.
- [ColorTool](https://github.com/MarcoPlatino/ColorTool), a Java project that contains various color utilities, such as RGB to Hexadecimal and vice versa, as well as a photography histogram generator.
- [Jumble Solver](https://github.com/MarcoPlatino/JumbleSolver), a (very) incomplete utility to solve the jumble puzzles in the newspaper. It is based off of qwen3 and uses ollama.
