# Welcome to my site!
My name is Marco Platino, and I am a student looking to build all sorts of interesting software and learn new concepts.

My technical skills include:
- Python
- Arduino
- Onshape (CAD)
- Raspberry Pi
- Java
I am working currently on learning kotlin and android development.

### Things that will be added in the future:
I am planning to add a section of this site to show off all of the various projects that I have completed and posted on Github.
[This is the place to access that list](Projects.md)
